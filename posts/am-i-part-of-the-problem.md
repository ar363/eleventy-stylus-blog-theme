Oh dear, pray indulge me as I pose a most vexing inquiry: "Am I part of the problem?" With a heart heavy as lead and a mind in disarray, I implore you to ponder this question with me. For in these tumultuous times, as society's woes continue to mount, we must look inward and ask ourselves, "Do our actions, our words, our very being contribute to the problems that plague our world?"

Let us not turn a blind eye nor deaf ear to the cries of those who suffer, but instead, let us embark on a journey of self-reflection, of introspection, and of change. The world is full of problems. As long as life exists in the universe (and most probably after, as well) problems will continue to arise and decisions will have to be made. The past few years felt like the world took a deep dive into a pool of never ending and threatening situations. A global pandemic that took some and temporarily disabled others, multiple wars that cost the lifes of free people, an increase in the cost of living and an accelerated climate change fueled by an energy crisis are just some of the challenges that my generation has to deal with. It's not terrible, but it's not great either.

The question that acts as a catalyst for multiple heated conversations on the internet, is who's to blame. Is it the government? Or, maybe, the state. What about my individual contibution to the problem? Nah, it must be a common societal disability. Most likely, something that stems from the never ending class struggle and the pathogenic nature of capitalism. 

Well, I would like to suggest a framework. I summed everything up in a small app for your convenience. In this exercise one has to think of problem. Once this has been identified, then the following questions must be answered sincerely.
