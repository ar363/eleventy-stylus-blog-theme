> I don’t want to waste my time. Become another casualty of society. I’ll never fall in line. Become another victim of your conformity and back down. – Fat Lip, Sum 41

This is a song from 2001. I was 2 years old and had zero skills. Well, maybe I had, I can't be sure. I have a picture from that era that I am slamming a keyboard. But that is not the point. This was big time. Mainstream. Didn't people hear the lyrics?

Have you ever been in a brothel? I haven't. I find them to be too honest for my liking. Real relationships are dishonest and theatrical and that suits my taste as a white-collar yuppie that I pretend to be.

But I know people that are frequent customers. They all tell me one thing: the employees are gonna do what they gonna do, and in the end you're gonna hate them for what they are, but they don't care because you will keep coming back.

Social media platforms are like brothels where creators are the whores and the consumers are the customers.

But social media platforms aren't honest, are they? Well, they are, you are not. You keep saying to yourself that you're just going there out of curiosity but in fact you go there for pleasure and because you like it.

But both are losers. The winner is the owner of the brothel.
